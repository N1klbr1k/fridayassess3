<div>
<h3>Art</h3>
<p>I take pride in the art that I create, but it is also a source of enjoyment for me.</p>
<div/>
<div>
<h3>Coding</h3>
<p>Coding is a skill I have been working on for a while. First, taking some college course on the matter. Then, some self study. Finally, at DevMountain I learn even more about this esoteric art.</p>

<h3>Latvian Fire Singing</h3>
<p>If you're reading this you fell for it. With a mere heading I could make you believe I was an expert in latvian fire singing. But of course you fell for it, that is because my 
    true skill is deception. Unfortunetly Latvian fire singing is not a real thing. Probably.

    <h3>ART</h3>
    <p>What? a repeat of sections, it outrageous. But for me art is not only a skills, but also an interest and hobby that I hone over time.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h3>DND</h3>
    <p>DND, which stands for dungeons and dragons, is a tabletop role playing game that I enjoy playing. Often I enjoy creating characters and then illustrating the characters I make using my skills with art. Currently, I am playing a Druid.

<div>
    <h3>Video Games</h3>
    <p>Playing video games is another diversion I find myself spending time. Possibly not my most productive of pastimes I find it taking up a chunk of time, nevertheless. The game I most commonly play is called Destiny 2, In which the player is an immortal space zombie with guns and elemental powers, accompanied by a small, slightly annoying, phylactery.</p>

        <h3>Career goals</h3>
        <p> This section will Probably be much shorter. In my career I aim to become a web developer. In this field I would like to be a full Stack developer so that I can apply all the skills that I learned at DevMountain</p>
